# 📚 Book Recommendation System

This repository contains a **Book Recommendation System** powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **LangChain**, **Hugging Face**, and **Gemini AI**. It delivers **personalized book recommendations** based on semantic similarity, emotional tone, and category filtering.

                                 Heres a Screenshot of recommendation system

## 🚀 Features

- **🔍 Semantic Search**  
  Uses embeddings generated by Gemini AI to find books similar to user queries.

- **🎭 Emotional Tone Filtering**  
  Recommends books based on emotional tones like *Happy*, *Surprising*, *Angry*, *Suspenseful*, and *Sad*.

- **📚 Category Filtering**  
  Enables users to refine recommendations by selecting from various book categories.

- **🖥️ Interactive Dashboard**  
  Built with **Gradio**, the UI allows users to input descriptions, apply filters, and view recommendations interactively.
